A little child is studying arithmetic. They have just learned how to add two integers, written one below another, column by column. But the child always forgets about the important part - carrying.

Given two integers, your task is to find the result that the child will get.

Note: The child had learned from this site, so feel free to check it out too if you are not familiar with column addition.

Example

For param1 = 456 and param2 = 1734, the output should be
solution(param1, param2) = 1180.

   456
  1734
+ ____
  1180
The child performs the following operations from right to left:

6 + 4 = 10 but the child forgets about carrying the 1 and just writes down the 0 in the last column
5 + 3 = 8
4 + 7 = 11 but the child forgets about the leading 1 and just writes down 1 under 4 and 7.
There is no digit in the first number corresponding to the leading digit of the second one, so the child imagines that 0 is written before 456. Thus, they get 0 + 1 = 1.
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 0.5 seconds (cpp)

[input] integer param1

A non-negative integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ param1 < 105.

[input] integer param2

A non-negative integer.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ param2 < 6 · 104.

[output] integer

The result that the little child will get by using column addition without carrying.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  int solution(int param1, int param2) {
    int s=0;
    int i=0;
    while((param1!=0)||(param2!=0) ){
       int k = (param1%10+param2%10);
       if(k>9) s+=(k-10)*pow(10, i);
       else s+=k*pow(10, i);
       param1/=10;
       param2/=10;
       i++;
    }
    return s;
}
