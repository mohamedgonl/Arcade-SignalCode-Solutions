Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
In most role-playing games, die rolls required by the system are given in the form AdX. A and X are positive integers, separated by the letter 'd', which stands for die or dice.

A is the number of times the die should be rolled (usually omitted if 1).
X is the number of faces on the die.
To this basic notation, an additive modifier can be appended that yields expressions in the form AdX+B or AdX-B. B is a number added to the sum of the rolls (or subtracted from it). So, 1d20-10 would indicate a single roll of a 20-sided die with 10 being subtracted from the result.

You're reading the rules of a famous Bugs and Bugfixes role-playing game involving dice. What is the maximum number of points you can get, assuming that you roll the dice according to each formula present within rules?

It is guaranteed that all the formulas that appear in rules are correct (i.e. A and X are always positive in a formula-like substring), and any two substrings that may be formulas do not overlap.

Example

For rules = "Roll d6-3 and 4d4+3 to pick a weapon, and finish the boss with 3d7!",
the output should be
solution(rules) = 43.

There are three formulas in the rules.

d6-3 indicates a single roll of a 6-sided die, with 3 subtracted from the result. The maximum number that is possible to get is thus 6 - 3 = 3.
4d4+3 stands for 4 rolls of a 4-sided die, with 3 added to the result. It is possible to get 4 * 4 + 3 = 19 points.
3d7 means 3 rolls of a 7-sided die. The maximum number to obtain with it is 3 * 7 = 21.

[input] string rules

Rules given as a string.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 â‰¤ rules.length â‰¤ 100.

[output] integer

The maximum possible number of points. If there are no formulas in rules, the output should be 0.

      if (it->str(3)[0] == '-') {
        formulaMax -= std::stoi(it->str(3).substr(1));
      }
      else {
        formulaMax += std::stoi(it->str(3).substr(1));
      }

    res += formulaMax;
    it++;
